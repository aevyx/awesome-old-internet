# 🌟 Community Guidelines

Welcome! To maintain the quality and focus of this awesome list, please adhere to these guidelines.

## ✍️ Pull Request (PR) Requirements

1.  **Scope:** Ensure the resource is **genuinely useful, actively maintained, and strictly relevant** to the list's theme. Quality over quantity is key.
2.  **Format:** Use the exact markdown format:
    `* [**Resource Name**](Link to resource) - A brief, one-sentence description ending with a period.`
3.  **Placement:** Add the new item to the **end** of the most appropriate category.
4.  **No Duplicates/Self-Promotion:** Check if the item exists. Submissions must be judged on merit, not solely self-promotion.
5.  **Title/Description:** Use a descriptive PR title (e.g., `Add FooBar Library`). Explain briefly *why* the item is awesome in the PR description.

## ❌ Removal/Rejection Policy

Maintainers will reject submissions or remove existing entries if they are:

* Stale, broken, or abandoned.
* Non-compliant with the formatting rules.
* Overly commercial, unless explicitly allowed by a specific category.
* Deemed low-quality or irrelevant.

## 🙋‍♀️ Reporting

* **Broken Links / Stale Items:** Open an **Issue**, do not use a PR.
* **Be Respectful:** All contributors must maintain a professional and constructive tone.
